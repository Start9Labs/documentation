How can I contribute to StartOS?
--------------------------------
Please follow the guide `here <https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ and reach out to the `Community Dev <https://matrix.to/#/#community-dev:matrix.start9labs.com>`_ channel on Matrix with any questions.

Do I need to be a professional developer or have coding experience to contribute?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely not!  Contributions can be as simple as finding a typo in our docs, making a suggestion on GitHub, creating educational or promotional content, and the list goes on!  Everyone that wants to contribute can do so in some unique way.  

First check our :ref:`Contributing<contribute>` section and please don't hesitate to :ref:`Contact <contact>` us for ideas if you're not sure where to begin.
