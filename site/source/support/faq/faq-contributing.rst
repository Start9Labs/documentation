How can I contribute to StartOS?
--------------------------------
Please follow the guide `here <https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ and reach out to the `Community Dev <https://matrix.to/#/#community-dev:matrix.start9labs.com>`_ channel on Matrix with any questions.

Do I need to be a professional developer or have coding experience to contribute?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely not!  Contributions can be as simple as finding a typo in our docs, making a suggestion on GitHub, creating educational or promotional content, spreading the word, and the list goes on!  Everyone that wants to contribute can do so in some unique way.  

First check our `Contributing <https://start9.com/contribute>`_ page and please don't hesitate to `Contact <https://start9.com/contact>`_ us for ideas if you're not sure where to begin.
