Upgrade Your Raspberry Pi
=========================
Follow this guide to upgrade from a Raspberry Pi StartOS server to a Server One, Server Pure, or similar device.

From Pi with External Drive
---------------------------
If your current Raspberry Pi setup uses an external drive over USB.

#. Shutdown your Raspberry Pi server and disconnect from power. If you have a speaker, wait for shutdown noises.

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/_static/sounds/SHUTDOWN.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>

    * Shutdown sound

#. Connect your new server to power and ethernet.

#. Select the destination drive that you are migrating *to* (this will erase any data on this drive):

#. You will be asked to create a password. It can be the same as it was previously.

#. Your data will now transfer over - the length of this process will vary depending on how much data you have, but will likely take several hours.

#. You are now ready to proceed and use your new server - it will have the same addresses and Root CA as it did before.

    .. warning:: DO NOT reconnect your old server without first wiping the SD card and SSD! This can cause serious problems! If you have lightning channels you could lose your money!
