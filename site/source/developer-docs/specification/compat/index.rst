Compat Image
============

With the release of StartOS v0.3.0, system utility Docker images are preloaded for service packager convenience. 

The ``Compat`` image is a backwards compatible Docker image that hosts StartOS features used in the v0.2.x series. It was created as a convenience for service packagers to help migrate their service configurations from 0.2.x to 0.3.0. 

It exposes functionality to make use of:

- ``ConfigRules`` language
- Duplicity backups
