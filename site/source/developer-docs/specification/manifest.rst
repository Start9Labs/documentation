Manifest
========

Overview
--------

This file describes the service and it's requirements. It is used to:

- create a listing in the marketplace
- denote any installation considerations
- define dependency requirements
- define actions such as health checks, backups, and configuration
- define alerts and other messaging / descriptions for the user interface

Each time a service is updated, the Manifest should be updated to include the new version, release notes, and any pertinent updates to the install, uninstall, or restoration flows. All this information is displayed in the marketplace listing, and the optionally denoted alerts will be displayed when appropriate to provide the user with more information.

There is nothing you need to do as a developer to set up Tor for running a service. This is *completely* handled by StartOS - a Tor address will be automatically generated when the service is installed. Just define an interface with a tor config in the Manifest file. You do, however, need to ensure the service is in fact capable of running over Tor.

The Manifest is also responsible for outlining service :ref:`dependencies <dependencies-spec>`. By defining rules using the :ref:`StartOS DSL specification <config_rules>`, users can easily and selectively install, uninstall, and update any service without getting stuck in dependency hell. StartOS presents this information in a polished install/uninstall/update wizard, so there's no need for editing configuration files or jumping into the command line. For you as a developer, this simply means populating this key in the manifest!

Formatting
----------

- Serialization language:``yaml | toml | json``
- Case style: ``kebab-case``

Type definitions
----------------

Below are the types and sub-type definitions, with necessary elaborations. Any item that contains ``Option<>`` is an optional field.

.. code:: yaml

    # The package identifier used by the OS
    id: String
    # A human readable service title
    title: String
    # Service version - accepts up to four digits, where the last confirms to revisions necessary for StartOS - see documentation: https://github.com/Start9Labs/emver-rs. This value will change with each release of the service.
