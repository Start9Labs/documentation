5 - Create Manifest
===================

The Manifest file specifies the details embassyOS needs to operate a service. It is the connection point between your service and embassyOS. 

In this file, values and actions exist for:

- Displaying the service in the marketplace
- Specifying the project assets (eg. icon, instructions, license)
- Defining the docker mount points
- Specifying how to configure the service
- Relaying how to run health checks, backups, and other custom actions
- Outlining dependency relationships (if applicable) and configuration rules for dependencies
- Denoting copy to display in EmbassyUI elements, alerts, descriptions

This file can be written in:

- yaml
- toml
- json

Let's create a yaml manifest file for our hello-world project:

.. code:: bash

    touch manifest.yaml

And populate it with the following example manifest (see the line comments for a description of each key and view the full :ref:`type specification here <service_manifest>`):

.. code:: yaml
    
    # The package identifier used by the OS
    id: hello-world 
    # A human readable service title
    title: "Hello World"
    # Service version - accepts up to four digits, where the last confirms to revisions necessary for embassyOS - see documentation: https://github.com/Start9Labs/emver-rs
    version: 0.3.0
    # Release notes for the update - can be a string, paragraph or URL
    release-notes: "Upgrade to embassyOS v0.3.0"
    # The type of license for the project. Include the LICENSE in the root of the project directory. A license is required for a Start9 package.
    license: mit
    # The Start9 wrapper repository URL for the package. This repo contains the manifest file (this), any scripts necessary for configuration, backups, actions, or health checks (more below). This key must exist. But could be embedded into the source repository.

    # The original project repository URL. There is no upstream repo in this example
    upstream-repo: "https://github.com/Start9Labs/hello-world-wrapper"

    # URL to the marketing site for the project. This key can be omitted if none exists, or it can link to the original project repository.

    # The series of commands to build the project into an s9pk for arm64/v8. In this case we are using a Makefile with the simple build command "make".

        Hello World is a simple example of a service wrapper that launches a web interface to say hello and nothing more.
    # These assets are static files necessary for packaging the service for Start9 (into an s9pk). Each value is a path to the specified asset. If an asset is missing from this list, or otherwise denoted, it will be defaulted to the values denoted below.
