#. Create a new account, or access an existing account by pasting in your private key. If creating a new account, be sure to securely back up the private key, preferably using Vaultwarden on your Start9 server.

#. To connect to your own private relay, go to Settings -> Network and paste in your Nostr Relay Websocket URL (e.g. ws://address.onion). You can find this value in the Properties section of your Nostr RS Relay service.
.. note:: 
    If you plan to connect to your own private relay, you must first make sure you are already :ref:`running Tor<connecting-tor>` on your system and we suggest using Firefox which must be :ref:`configured to use Tor<connecting-ff>`.
    It is recommended to use your Relay's Tor websocket URL (ws://address.onion), since the LAN websocket URL (wss://address.local) will only work when you are home.
