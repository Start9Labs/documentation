#. Choose how to setup your relays and create a new account or access an existing account by using a nip-07 browser extension. If creating a new account, be sure to securely back up the private key, preferably using Vaultwarden on StartOS.

#. To connect to your own private relay, go to Relays -> App Relays, paste in your Nostr Relay Websocket URL (e.g. ws://address.onion) and click add. You can find this value in the Properties section of your Nostr RS Relay service.  

    .. note:: 
        If you plan to connect to your own private relay, you must use `Tor browser <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ or :ref:`run Tor<connecting-tor>` on your system.  We recommend using Firefox which must be :ref:`configured to use Tor<connecting-ff>`.  
        It is recommended to use your Relay's Tor websocket URL (ws://address.onion), since the LAN websocket URL (wss://address.local) will only work when you are home.
