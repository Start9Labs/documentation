Connect to LND via Lightning Node Connect (LNC)
===============================================

Lightning Node Connect (LNC) provides a very simple way to connect to an LND node that **does not require the Tor network**. 

.. warning:: This is NOT the guide for setting up **AlbyHub** this is for a direct connection to LND. If you'd like to connect via AlbyHub instead (recommended), click :ref:`here<albyhub>`.

.. warning:: This is **not** the same as **connecting directly to LND** for which guides can be found :ref:`here<connecting-lnd>`.



.. note:: This requires installing the `Lightning Terminal <https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/lightning-terminal>`_ service on your Start9 server.

The following two guides go over how to connect wallets to LND via LNC.
