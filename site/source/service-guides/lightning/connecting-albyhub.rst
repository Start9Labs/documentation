Connect to LND with AlbyHub
===========================

.. note:: Connecting to LND via **AlbyHub** is a very powerful way to interact with LND in a self sovereign way by running AlbyHub on your *own server* and not on external servers outside of your control. 
  But to connect to LND *without* AlbyHub, see :ref:`here<connecting-lnd>`.
