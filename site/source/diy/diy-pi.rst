Start9 is committed to ensuring that StartOS is accessible.  It will always be possible to build your own Start9 server similar to the ones we sell.  This guide is to build a device exactly like Start9's Server One, available for purchase on the `Start9 Store <https://store.start9.com/products/server-one>`_.
