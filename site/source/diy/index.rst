Here you will find guides for building your own Server!  Currently, embassyOS supports the Raspberry Pi and on most x86_64 platforms (desktops, laptops, mini PCs, servers, and virtual machines).

Motivation
----------
There are several reasons you might prefer to build your own Embassy instead of purchasing one from us:

    #. You already own the necessary hardware and would like to re-purpose it.
    #. You want to save on shipping or import costs to your location.
    #. You do not trust Start9's supply chain.
    #. You do not want to share your shipping address.
    #. You like building things.
