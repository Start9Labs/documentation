Here you will find guides for building your own Embassy!  Currently, embassyOS is supported on the Raspberry Pi (ARM architecture), and on most desktops, laptops, mini PCs, servers, and virtualization solutions (x86).

Motivation
----------
There are several reasons you might prefer to build your own Embassy instead of purchasing one from us:

    #. You already own the necessary hardware and would like to re-purpose it.
    #. You want to save on shipping or import costs to your location.
    #. You do not trust Start9's supply chain.
    #. You do not want to share your shipping address.
    #. You like building things.
