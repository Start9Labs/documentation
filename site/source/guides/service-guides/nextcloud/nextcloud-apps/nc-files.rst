Nextcloud Files
===============
Nextcloud Files is software for managing and syncing your data between your devices.  In practice it functions similarly to the file explorer on your computer.  Files also serves as the base storage on your server for all the other apps that may need to access your data, such as documents, multimedia, and syncing apps.  This even includes data storage for other Start9 services on your server, such as Jellyfin and Start9 Pages.  

Integrations available for:

- Mobile
    - Android
    - iOS

- Desktop
    - Linux
    - Mac
    - Windows

NC App Setup
------------
#. You will find an icon in your top menu for "Files."  Click here to get started.

    - You can begin using your Files app right away in the web UI.  All changes will be reflected in any currently synced client devices, or on any added in future.

    .. warning:: Keep in mind that if you delete a file in one location, it may be deleted across all locations!!  Start with some test folders/files in order to understand how the syncing system works with your devices.
