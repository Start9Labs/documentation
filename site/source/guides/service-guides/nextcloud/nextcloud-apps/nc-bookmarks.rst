Nextcloud Bookmarks
===================
`Nextcloud Bookmarks <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/bookmarks>`_ is software for sorting, tagging, searching, sharing, and (most importantly) syncing your browser's bookmarks via your server.  First set up your :ref:`client devices<nextcloud-setup>`, so that Nextcloud will automatically keep your bookmarks synced.

Clients available for:

- Mobile
    - Android

- Desktop Browsers
    - Chrome
    - Edge
    - Firefox

NC App Setup
------------
#. Begin by downloading Bookmarks from your Nextcloud service's App Store (Top-right menu -> Apps).

    .. tip:: Use the "Search" function to quickly find the App you are looking for

#. Once installed/enabled, you will get a new icon in your top menu for "Bookmarks."  Click it to get started.

    - At this point you can begin adding bookmarks directly into the app, or import them from a browser.  These are always available by accessing your Nextcloud from your client devices.

    - The real power here is in the ability to import or sync across devices.  There are several clients that can accomplish this, which can be found on the `NC Bookmarks Github Page <https://github.com/nextcloud/bookmarks#third-party-clients>`_.  For our example, and the recommended option if you click "Sync with your browser" from the Bookmarks welcome page, is `Floccus <https://floccus.org/>`_.

#. (Optional) In the "Settings" menu in the bottom-left, you may change the Nextcloud location in which to store your bookmarks.  If you change this or create a new folder, be sure to reflect this change in Floccus below.

Browser & Mobile Setups
-----------------------

Floccus (Browser & Android)
...........................

#. Download the appropriate Floccus extension for your browser or app from the App Store, F-Droid, or Play Store.

#. Open the Floccus browser extension and click "+NEW ACCOUNT", select "Nextcloud Bookmarks", and then add your server address and login via Nextcloud.

#. (Optional) Edit the folder paths if changed above and select a local folder to save bookmarks to.

#. On the final setup page, use the defaults unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing.  Click "Continue" and you're ready to sync!

    .. note:: Repeat this process for any additional devices or browsers that you'd like to keep in sync.
