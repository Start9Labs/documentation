Calendar & Contacts Syncing
===========================
You can set up your devices using their :ref:`integrations<nextcloud-setup>`, but if you wish to use a standalone client for your Calendar and Contacts syncing, we recommend Mozilla's `Thunderbird <https://www.thunderbird.net>`_.

1. Install the :ref:`Calendar<nc-calendar>` and :ref:`Contacts<nc-contacts>` apps in Nextcloud if they are not currently installed.
2. Add your :ref:`RootCA<trust-ca>` to your system and then configure :ref:`Thunderbird<lan-thunderbird>`.

3. Select Calendar or Contacts from below to complete each unique setup:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Calendar 

    1. In Thunderbird, click on the calendar icon, then "New Address Book" in the bottom-left.

    2. Choose "On the network," then click "Next".

    4. Create a unique app password - In your Nextcloud WebUI, visit the top-right-hand menu and select "Personal Settings" -> "Security." At the bottom, under "Devices & Sessions," create a new app password with a name of your choice, such as "CalDAV." Copy the resulting password and paste it into Thunderbird.
