After setup has been completed per the Instructions on the StartOS Jellyfin service page, there are many ways to connect to and use your Jellyfin server.

.. note:: While the Jellyfin server is accessable over tor for many clients, connecting over LAN via your Jellyfin ``.local`` URL is recommended for the best streaming experience.

Web Application
---------------
1. Launch the Jellyfin web application from the desired interface (``.local`` recommended). If you are having trouble connecting, make sure your browser and OS have been setup to connect to :ref:`LAN <connecting-lan>` or :ref:`Tor <connecting-tor>` depending on the interface you are using.

2. Open the app, you will be prompted for a host; paste the URL (``.local`` recommended) from your Jellyfin service page -> Interfaces in this field. 

  .. tip:: If you are getting connection errors, make sure you are connected to the same LAN and a VPN is not blocking use on your Android device.

Other Clients
-------------
Jellyfin has numerous other `clients <https://jellyfin.org/downloads/>`_, not all of which have been tested at the time of this writing. If you are able to test (successfully or unsucessfully) an app not documented in this guide, your feedback would be much appreciated.

.. note:: Some clients such as 'Jellyfin for Roku' and 'Swiftfin' (tvOS) are not configured to use Local DNS - as a result, these clients are unable to resolve private urls like ``.local``.
