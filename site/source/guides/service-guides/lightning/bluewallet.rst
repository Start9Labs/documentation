BlueWallet
----------

.. note:: This guide assumes you have already setup LNbits as per :ref:`this guide <connecting-lnbits>` with **LND** as your underlying node.

.. warning:: **This will not work with CLN as your underlying node!**

#. Bluewallet requires that we use the LnbHub extension in order to connect to LNbits.

#. To do this, click **Manage Extensions**:

#. Click **MANAGE** under the LndHub extension:

#. Click the two arrows on the right, then click install:

#. Now ensure that it says **Activated** underneath LndHub and then click **Extensions** on the left:

#. Make sure the wallet you just created is selected below the two QR codes:

#. Click "Scan or import a file"

    .. note:: Screenshots not possible for this step!

#. *If you only want this wallet to be able to RECEIVE PAYMENTS, scan this QR code:*

    *If you are happy for this wallet to be able to both receive and MAKE payments scan this QR code:*

#. You'll see this once the wallet is added:

#. In addition to allocating sats to this wallet via the LNbits Superuser Account (see "Funding LNbits section" :ref:`here<connecting-lnbits>`), you can also receive funds the normal way by hitting "Receive" within BlueWallet.

    .. note:: Funds received this way must be sent from another lightning node, not the LND node underneath LNbits. A lightning payment that originates and terminates at the same node is technically a rebalance, not a normal payment.

Congratulations! BlueWallet is set up and ready to use lightning via your own lightning node - furthermore it will only be able to use your node in the way you allow it, via LNbits.
