embassyOS allows users to swap to an alternative Marketplace in case they want a service not offered in the official `Start9 Marketplace <https://marketplace.start9.com>`_, would like a backup registry, or have for some reason lost trust in `Start9 <https://start9.com>`_.

    - In order to change to an unofficial Marketplace, you can see our documentation :ref:`here <alt-marketplaces>`.

You can even run your own Marketplace using your Embassy!  On each service's GitHub Releases page, such as `Bitcoin <https://github.com/Start9Labs/bitcoind-wrapper/releases/tag/v23.0.0>`_ for example, you will find the ``.s9pk`` Asset.  You can download this package, upload to a folder on `File Browser <https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/filebrowser>`_ or `Nextcloud <https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/nextcloud>`_, and then host it over :ref:`Tor<tor>` using `Embassy Pages <https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/embassy-pages>`_!

A full specification to mimic our production Marketplace is forthcoming.
