EmbassyOS allows users to swap to an alternative Marketplace in case they want a service not offered in the official `Start9 Marketplace <https://marketplace.start9.com>`_, would like a backup registry, or have for some reason lost trust in :ref:`Start9 <start9>`.

    - In order to change to an unofficial Marketplace, you can see our documentation :ref:`here <alt-marketplaces>`.
