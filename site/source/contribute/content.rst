Feedback
--------
We thrive on user feedback!

Write reviews or blog posts on Medium, Substack, Reddit, Mastodon, Twitter, or others

It may not seem like it, but a single review can teach us a lot.  Further, as these reviews add up, we can better understand pain points and popular requests.

Whether you just like our ethos, had a good experience with a support call, or want to do a full unboxing/test/review/how-to, ALL feedback is valuable and helps spread the message at the same time!

Notes:
    - Tag us!!  We read them all, but we will not see them if they are not brought to our attention.
    - Give details.  If you have no complaints, that's great, but please list something specific that you DO like.
