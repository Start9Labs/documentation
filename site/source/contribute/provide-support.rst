We aim to offer world-class support, but we need all the help we can get!

Community Channels
------------------

1. If you see a query in one of our :ref:`Community Channels <contact>` that has not been answered, please respond!

    - It is important for humans to be heard, so even letting someone know that the team may be offline can mean a lot.  You can mention that the team is most active during North American daylight hours.
    - If you are confident you have the answer to a question, you may answer it yourself.  We ask that you please be certain that you know the correct answer.  You can always verify with a team member first or direct the inquirer to the relevant section of these docs (often the :ref:`FAQ<faq>`).  This may also lead to suggestions about docs additions or edits.

2. Participate in our `Github Discussions <https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os/discussions>`_ channel.

3. Make your voice heard in the unofficial feedback forum: https://s9.altweb.me/

4. If you would like to take on a more significant role in Support, please reach out to us at jobs@start9.com, or in one of our :ref:`Community Channels <contact>`.

    - We are working on a volunteer program, which we eventually hope to incentivize.
    - It is also a foot in the door with Start9, where we are always growing and often in need of new team members.
