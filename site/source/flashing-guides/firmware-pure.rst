Firmware (Server Pure)
======================
This page is for Server Pure / Purism Librem Mini users ONLY.  This firmware is custom for these devices.

Generally, you do not need to manually flash your device using this guide, as the firmware is now automatically updated on supported devices.  Please only use this method if directed by a Start9 Support Technician.

Downloading the right firmware
------------------------------

The source code can be viewed on Purism's `firmware git repo <https://source.puri.sm/firmware/releases/-/tree/master/librem_mini_v2/custom>`_.  You will need a USB flash drive, formatted FAT32, to flash the firmware to your server.

Flashing the firmware
---------------------

#. Copy or move the zip of the firmware file onto your USB drive formatted to FAT32, then eject the drive and insert it into your (powered down) server.  USB 3.0 (blue ports) will be faster.

    .. note:: You'll need a monitor and keyboard plugged into your server for this operation
    .. caution:: USB drive **must** be formatted with the FAT32 filesystem

#. Turn on the server while pressing the ``ESC`` key on the keyboard repeatedly until you see the PureBoot Basic Boot Menu screen.  Select "Options -->"
