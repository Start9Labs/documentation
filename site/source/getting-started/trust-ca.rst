Trusting Your Root CA
=====================

Download and trust your server's Root Certificate Authority (Root CA) to enable encrypted communications locally and enhance speeds over Tor.

Download Your Server's Root CA
------------------------------
Your server's Root CA was included in the downloaded file at the end of initial setup. If you do not have that file, you can find your server's Root CA inside the StartOS dashboard.

	#. Navigate to `System > Root CA` and click `Download Certificate`
