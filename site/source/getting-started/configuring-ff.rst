===================
Configuring Firefox 
===================
Firefox is a privacy-focused browser that can be configured to resolve LAN (`.local`) URLs and Tor (`.onion`) URLs without affecting normal browser functionality. We highly recommend using Firefox for connecting to your server and its installed services.

.. note:: For iOS, we recommend Safari instead of Firefox. That is because on iOS, all browsers use Safari under the hood anyway, so it is preferable not to stack unnecessary software on top of it.

Select your OS:
