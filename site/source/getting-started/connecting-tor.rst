Connecting Remotely
===================
You can connect to your server from anywhere in the world, privately and anonymously, by using its unique Tor Address (`.onion` URL)

.. note:: It is normal for Tor connections to be slow or unreliable at times

Using The Tor Browser
---------------------
Using the official Tor Browser allows you to access `.onion` URLs without additional configuration. However, accessing clearnet (`.com`, `.org`, ect) websites will also be routed over Tor, making them slower, and `.local` URLs cannot be accessed at all.

* Linux, Mac, Windows, Android

    * `Tor Browser <https://torproject.org/download/>`_

* iOS

    * iOS lacks a well-functioning Tor Browser. Instead, we recommend :ref:`using Safari with Orbot<tor-ios>`.
