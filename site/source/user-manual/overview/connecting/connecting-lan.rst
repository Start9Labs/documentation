LAN Connections
===============
Whenever you are connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your Start9 server, it is best to access your Start9 server's LAN Address (.local URL). LAN connections are fast and secure and do not even require Internet access!

Select your OS below to connect via LAN.  See our :ref:`Device Guides<device-guides>` section for all your client's setup guides.

  :ref:`Linux<lan-linux>`
  :ref:`Mac<lan-mac>`
  :ref:`Windows<lan-windows>`
  :ref:`Android<lan-android>`
