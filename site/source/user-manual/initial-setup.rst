Powering On
-----------

#. Connect your Embassy to power and Ethernet.

    .. tip:: To avoid networking issues, it is recommended to use your `primary` router, not an extender or mesh router.

#. You will hear 2 distinct sounds:

    .. raw:: HTML

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/_static/sounds/BEP.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>

    * "bep" - Starting up

    .. raw:: HTML

      <audio controls>
        <source src="/_static/sounds/CHIME.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>

    * "chime" - Embassy is ready

    .. caution:: If you followed the DIY guide and built EmbassyOS from source code, it may take up to 20 minutes to first initialize.

Claiming your Device
--------------------

#. Ensure the device you are using (desktop/laptop or mobile) is connected to the same network as your Embassy.

    .. caution:: Sometimes a router will have a "guest WiFi network," which might be different than the network your Embassy is placed on via ethernet.

#. Visit http://embassy.local from your web browser.

#. Select "Start Fresh"

    .. note:: The "Recover" button is used for :ref:`migrating from 0.2.x <upgrade-02>` or :ref:`restoring from backup <backup-restore>`.

#. Select your storage drive. There should only be one drive in the list.

    .. tip:: Click "Download This Page" to save your Embassy address and certificate info on your computer.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are experiencing issues with setup, try the following:

#. Confirm that the Embassy is plugged into both power and Ethernet
#. Confirm the Embassy emitted two sounds when powering on: a bep and a chime
#. Confirm your phone/computer is **not** connected to a "Guest" network
#. Confirm your phone/computer is not using a VPN
#. Refresh the embassy.local browser page
#. Very rarely, a router may not support mDNS. In this case:

    - From your browser, navigate to your router configuration settings. This is usually an IP address such as 192.168.1.1. A simple web search will usually reveal how to access the router configuration settings for a particular brand.
    - Once in the router config settings, find the section that lists the devices on your network. You should see an item labeled "embassy". Take note of the associated IP address and enter it into your browser's URL field to enter the setup.

If you are still having issues, please :ref:`contact support <contact>`.
