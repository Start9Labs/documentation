Power

* **Log Out**

    * This will log you out and return you to the log in screen.

* **Restart**

    * Be patient while services shut down. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete.
    * A gentle *bep* will sound when the server is powered back on.
    * A *chime* will sound when the server is ready to use.  Please be patient as a Restart will take some time.

* **Shutdown**

    .. caution:: After a shutdown, the *only* way to turn your server back on is to unplug it and plug it back in. As such, we do not recommend shutting down your server when you are not physically near it. Instead, you should use the restart option.

    * Be patient while services shut down, it may take some minutes. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete.
    * It is now safe to unplug your server from power and the ethernet cable, if connected.

* **System Rebuild**

    This action will tear down all service containers and rebuild them from scratch. No data will be deleted. This action is useful if your system gets into a bad state, and it should only be performed if you are experiencing general performance or reliability issues. It may take multiple minutes to complete. During this time, you will lose all connectivity to your server.
