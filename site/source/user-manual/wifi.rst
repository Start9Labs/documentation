Setting up WiFi
===============

Although a wired (ethernet) connection is recommended for best performance, you can connect your server with a wireless connection if you prefer. Follow the directions below to add one or more WiFi networks.

#. Go to *System > WiFi*.

#. Select your network from the list of available networks. You will get an idea of signal strength on the right, from red (weak signal) to green (strong signal). If you can move your server closer to the WiFi broadcasting device, you will get a better signal, and as a result, better performance.

   .. tip:: You may also select the network labeled "Other" at the bottom of the list in order to add a hidden network, or a network that is not nearby, for connecting to at a later time.

#. If you clicked "Save for Later", the network will appear in the list, unconnected. If you selected "Save and Connect", the network will attempt to connect and show a green checkmark upon success.
