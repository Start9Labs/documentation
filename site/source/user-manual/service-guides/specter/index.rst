There are two ways to use Specter with your Start9 server.

You can :ref:`run it as a service<specter-service>` in which case it will automatically connect to Bitcoin Core and can be optionally configured to connect via Electrs.

Alternatively you can `connect Specter Desktop via Tor <https://github.com/Start9Labs/bitcoind-wrapper/tree/master/docs/integrations/specter>`_.
