NC App Setup
------------
#. On the latest Start9 Nextcloud service, Contacts is included by default.  If coming from an older install, begin by downloading Contacts from your Nextcloud service's App Store (Top-right menu -> Apps).

    .. tip:: Use the "Search" function to quickly find the App you are looking for

#. Once installed/enabled, you will get a new icon in your top menu for "Contacts."  There is also a quick access icon in the top-right.  Click either to get started.

    - At this point you can begin using your Contacts app right away in the WebUI.  All changes will be reflected in any currently synced client devices, or on any added in future.
