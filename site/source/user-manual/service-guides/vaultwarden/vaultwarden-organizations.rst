Setting Up Organizations
========================

Creating an Organization
------------------------

If you want to share passwords amongst friends or family, you can do so using the "Organizations" feature of Vaultwarden.

#. Inside your :ref:`Web Vault<vaultwarden-webvault>`, click `New Organization`

#. Give your organization a name and enter your email. ``Note``: You can enter whatever you want for email, even `fake@email.com`. Because you are self-hosting, the email is not used for anything at all.

Adding Others to Your Organization
----------------------------------

.. warning::
   After you have completed signed up new members to your Vaultwarden server, it is highly recommended that you disable new user signups inside your :ref:`Admin Dashboard<vaultwarden-admin>` --> General Settings --> Allow new signups --> uncheck the box.

#. Tell the user to create an account on your Vaultwarden server. This must be done *before* you invite them.

#. Inside the Organization page, click Manage --> `Invite User`

#. Decide what permissions you want the member to have and click "Save". In the below example, the member will be a manager and have access to all collections.

#. The new member should automatically show as "Accepted". Now, click the settings icon on the right and click "Confirm"

#. You will be presented with a fingerprint phrase. The new member can verify this phrase inside their own dashboard, but because you are self-hosting and adding users manually, you can just click "Confirm".

The new member should now be able to see the organization in their own dashboard or client apps.
