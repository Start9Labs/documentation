===========

Vaultwarden is a self-hosted password manager, which means your passwords physically live on your Embassy. Be sure to create backups and keep them safe! If you lose your Embassy or uninstall Vaultwarden, and you have not made a backup, all your passwords will be lost forever.  If you currently have a *hosted* account with Bitwarden, you can export your data from that account and import it to your Vaultwarden service on Embassy using the built-in import/export features in any Bitwarden application.

.. note:: The version of Bitwarden server used on the Embassy is a fork called "Vaultwarden."  It functions with all of the apps/integrations that are built for, and still named after, "Bitwarden."  We apologize for any confusion this may cause.

Check out our `Vaultwarden video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcxxVHpm9j0>`_ for basic features and setup!
