Client Setup
============

Here you can setup your various devices and browsers to be able to access your Vaultwarden server.

Browser Extension
-----------------

    .. tabs::

        .. group-tab:: Tor

            If connecting via Tor (i.e using the .onion address) the Bitwarden browser extension will only work with a Tor enabled browser. You can use Firefox (recommended), Tor Browser or Brave Browser.

            #. If you choose Firefox, you will need to :ref:`setup Tor on your device <tor-os>` and :ref:`configure Firefox to use Tor <tor-firefox>`. If using Brave you will just need to :ref:`setup Tor on your device <tor-os>`. With Tor Browser, everything will just work right out of the box.

                .. tip:: We recommend using Firefox as it is the most compatible browser with Start9 Servers.

            #. In this example we will use Firefox, though these instructions will work just the same for Brave. First, install the `Bitwarden browser extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/>`_.  
            
            #. Head to the "Interfaces" tab in the Vaultwarden service on your Start9 Server:

                .. figure:: /_static/images/services/vaultwarden/vaultwarden-interfaces.png
                    :width: 50%
                    :alt: vaultwarden-interfaces

            #. Copy the Tor address:

                .. figure:: /_static/images/services/vaultwarden/vaultwarden-tor-address.png
                    :width: 50%
                    :alt: vaultwarden-tor-address

            #. Now head to the Bitwarden extension and click the cog in the top left. Under **Self-hosted environment** you will see a field for **Server URL**. Now we need to grab the address of our Vaultwarden server.

            #. Paste the address into your extension and click "Save"

            #. Now enter your credentials and the Bitwarden extension will be logged into your self-hosted Vaultwarden server!


        .. group-tab:: LAN

            We suggest using Tor, however it is possible have a good experience with LAN. Once synced, your app and all your passwords will be cached and available when you are on the go and not connected to your Start9 Server, and you will only need to be on LAN to update any edits to your vault.

            #. Start by installing the `Bitwarden browser extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/>`_.  
                        
            #. Head to the "Interfaces" tab in the Vaultwarden service on your Start9 Server:

                .. figure:: /_static/images/services/vaultwarden/vaultwarden-interfaces.png
                    :width: 50%
                    :alt: vaultwarden-interfaces

            #. Copy the LAN address:

                .. figure:: /_static/images/services/vaultwarden/vaultwarden-lan-address.png
                    :width: 50%
                    :alt: vaultwarden-lan-address

            #. Now head to the Bitwarden extension and click the cog in the top left. Under **Self-hosted environment** you will see a field for **Server URL**. Now we need to grab the address of our Vaultwarden server.

            #. Paste the address into your extension and click "Save"

            #. Now enter your credentials and the Bitwarden extension will be logged into your self-hosted Vaultwarden server!

Desktop Clients
---------------

    .. collapse:: Linux

        First, be sure to get Tor :ref:`running on your system <tor-linux>`.

        #. Install Bitwarden either by using a package manager like **apt** (we recommend against using **snap**) or download it from `here <https://bitwarden.com/download/>`_.

        #. Run the program with the flag ``--proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050`` behind it.  You can run this from a terminal, and if you'd like to use a shortcut, edit that shortcut file to include the flag.

        #. As with the other solutions above, click the 'Settings' icon, and enter your Vaultwarden Tor address.  You can then log in to your vault.

        Alternatively, you may be able to run using your LAN address, but this has proven finicky, especially on Debian/Ubuntu systems.  You will have better luck if you have the Root CA installed at the OS level.  First, be sure to :ref:`Setup LAN <lan-linux>` natively.

                #. Download the `Bitwarden Desktop app <https://bitwarden.com/download/>`_.

                #. Follow the Tor setup in the instructions below.  Make sure the Bitwarden directory is located in your user's directory, ``C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Local\Bitwarden``.  This is because you need permission to run over a proxy.  You can make a shortcut wherever you'd like.

                #. Right-click the shortcut and click 'Properties.'  Add the flag ``--proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050`` to the end of the 'Target' field.  Click 'Apply,' then 'OK.'  Close Properties and launch the shortcut.

                #. As with the other solutions above, click the 'Settings' icon, and enter your Vaultwarden Tor address.  You can then log in to your vault.

            .. group-tab:: LAN

                This is not known to work at this time - LAN is tricky with Windows due to the often unreliable Bonjour and Bonjour Print Services required for handling mDNS. We suggest using Tor anyway if you are able as you will then be able to maintain connectivity to your server from anywhere in the world.
