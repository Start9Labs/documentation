Instructions for accessing the bitcoind service in order to issue commands directly.

.. warning:: This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution. Start9 is not responsible for any damage you might cause through SSH access.

1. First, you will need SSH access.  Please see the :ref:`setup instructions <ssh>` for details.
2. Access your Embassy and then you can interact with the bitcoind docker container using the following syntax::

    sudo docker exec -ti bitcoind.embassy bitcoin-cli COMMAND

.. tip:: For example ``sudo docker exec -ti bitcoind.embassy bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo``

A list of possible commands can be found `here <https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-cli>`__.

You can also drop into a shell using::

    sudo docker exec -ti bitcoind.embassy bash

and then enter ``bitcoin-cli`` commands.  When you are finished, simply type ``exit``...
