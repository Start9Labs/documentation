To use a Spark client, you still first need to have Spark installed as a service on your Start9 Server.  The Spark service is both a server (background service) and a client (the :ref:`Web UI<web-ui>`).  Under Properties, there is a "Pairing URL". The first part of this is the server URL, and the end portion of it is the access key.
