You will need a high quality `USB-A to USB-A cable <https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Transfer-Enclosures-Printers-Cameras/dp/B00P0E3954/?th=1>`_, or a `USB-A to USB-C cable <https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-USB-Male-Cable/dp/B01GGKYKQM/?th=1>`_.

#. Connect the power to the NASPi - you will hear this sound and can ignore it:

#. Select the drive inside the NASPi (you may need to hit refresh):

#. Select the drive inside the Server Pro that you are migrating *to* (this will erase any data on this drive):

    .. figure:: /_static/images/setup/transfer-to.png
       :width: 60%

#. You will be asked to create a password. It can be the same as it was previously:

    .. figure:: /_static/images/setup/screen5-set_password.png
        :width: 60%

#. Your data will now transfer over - the length of this process will vary depending on how much data you have, but will likely take several hours:

    .. figure:: /_static/images/setup/screen6-storage_initialize.jpg
        :width: 60%

#. You are now ready to proceed and use your Server Pro - it will have the same addresses and root certificate as it did before migrating.

    .. warning:: Do not unders any circumstances reassemble your Server One without wiping the SD card first and wiping the SSD during initial setup! If you do not this will cause serious problems! If you have lightning channels you could lose all your funds!
