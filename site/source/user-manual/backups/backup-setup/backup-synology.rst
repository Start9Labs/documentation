Setup Network Folder
--------------------

#. In Synology UI, go to *Control Panel > Shared Folder* and select the folder you want to use.

    .. note:: Do not select "Use this shared folder" as folder encryption is not supported at this time
        
#. Back in Synology UI, go to *Control Panel > File Services > SMB* and click the SMB drop down button if it isn't already selected. Ensure that "Enable SMB service" is checked.

#. Under Advanced Settings on the same dropdown, set "Min SMB protocol" to SMB2 and "Max SMB protocol" to SMB3

#. On the rsync tab, under File Services -> turn on rsync protocol.

#. In the same dropdown, under "Note" will be "PC (Windows Explorer): \". This DeviceAddressName is the "Hostname" within the Embassy New Shared Folder dialog, and note that it is case sensitive and that the \ have been removed.

#. Back in Synonogy UI, click "File Station" and navigate so that you can see the the desired destination folder. Right click the folder, then *Properties > General*. Next to "Location" will be a folder location of the format ///, the / portion (so without the volume label) is the "Path" within the Embassy New Shared Folder dialog.

Connect Embassy
---------------

#. Go to *System > Create Backup*.

    * Path - This is the "Share Name" (name of the share in your samba config) and **not** the full directory path
    * Username - This is the user on the remote machine that you used to create the shared directory
    * Password - This is your user (from above) password
