    .. note::

        If you get the following dialogue box, you have designated your network "Public."  You may wish to change to "Private" if this is your home network.  Otherwise you may turn on network sharing for public networks.

#. Note the share's name, "SharedFolder" displayed in black text in the example screenshot below, above the long hostname and Windows directory path in grey text, both highlighted in blue.  We will take the share's name and enter it in the final step below.

Connect Embassy

#. Click "Open" to set up a new connection to your Shared Folder

#. Fill out the following fields as shown below:

    .. figure:: /_static/images/config/embassy_backup1.png
        :width: 60%

    - For "Hostname" - Enter your Windows computer name (this is shown after a ``\\`` in Windows)
    - For "Path" - Enter the share name displayed in the Windows sharing dialog shown in Step 4 above.  In our example this would be, literally, ``SharedFolder``
    - Enter your Windows username and password in the "User" and "Password" fields

.. caution::
    If you use a "PIN" to log in to Windows, keep in mind that your password needs to be the user's full password, NOT the PIN!  Office365 accounts also may **not** work, try a regular user in this case.

.. tip::
    If you recieve the following error:
    
    **Filesystem I/O Error mount error(115): Operation now in progress**

    Click Start > Settings > Network & Internet > Ethernet (or WiFi) and select the "Private" profile to treat your LAN as a trusted network that allows file sharing.

That's it!  You can now :ref:`Create<backup-create>` encrypted, private backups of all your Embassy data to your Windows machine or external drive!!
