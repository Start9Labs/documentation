There are 3 different ways that you may choose to recover server data, as well as a 4th option to migrate/transfer data between hardware.

#. "Restore [individual services] from Backup" to your currently running server.  This is specifically for service data.
#. "Use Existing Drive" a drive with existing server data on it during setup.  Use this when re-flashing your SD card, for example.
#. "Restore [entire server] from Backup" (as in, disaster recovery) all server data in the event that your backup is the **only** thing you have left.
#. "Transfer" data from an existing server.  This is a total migration for use when upgrading hardware only.

.. warning:: If you are restoring data from a drive that you are attaching *directly to your server,* (if using a RasPi or other low-powered board) please ensure that it is getting adequate power.  This is best accomplished via external power to the drive (such as a powered USB hub).  Server One (2022 and newer) and Server Pro users can safely ignore this warning.

Select the appropriate tab below to restore your data:

        It is not possible to recover services that are already installed. If you wish to recover a service that is already installed, please uninstall it first to permit recovery.

        #. During :ref:`Initial Setup<initial-setup>`, select "Recover."

        #. Your server will now prepare and then copy the data to the new drive.  The time required can vary greatly depending on how much data you are migrating and from where that data is coming.  Be prepared for this to take many hours, especially if you have 1-2TB+ of data.  Go have a sandwich and contemplate other aspects of your sovereignty.

You may need to try a different USB port and hit "Refresh" if you don't see it immediately.  You will see a warning about using the old drive again; read and understand it.
