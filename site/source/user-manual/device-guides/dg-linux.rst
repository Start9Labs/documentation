To optimize your device for use with your Start9 server, it is recommended to complete all of the following guides.

* :ref:`lan-linux` - Trust your Start9 server's Root Certificate Authority in order to securely connect over LAN.
* :ref:`tor-linux` - Run Tor natively (in the background) on your Linux machine. This will allow you to use applications on your machine via the Tor Network so they can communicate with your Start9 server.
* :ref:`torff-linux` - Configure Firefox to use the Tor Network so that you can reach ".onion" sites without needing to change browsers.
* :ref:`backup-linux` - Configure a Network Folder on your Linux machine (or an attached external drive) for StartOS backups.
