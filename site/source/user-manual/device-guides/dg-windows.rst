To optimize your device for use with your Embassy, it is recommended to complete all of the following guides.

.. tip:: Please see Window's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-windows>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices.

* :ref:`lan-windows` - Trust your Embassy's Root Certificate Authority in order to securely connect over LAN.
* :ref:`tor-windows` - Run Tor natively (in the background) on your Windows computer. This will allow you to use applications on your machine via the Tor Network so they can communicate with your Embassy.
* :ref:`torff-windows` - Configure Firefox to use the Tor Network so that you can reach ".onion" sites without needing to change browsers.
* :ref:`backup-windows` - Configure a network folder on your Windows computer (or an attached external drive) for Embassy backups.
