To optimize your device for use with your Start9 server, it is recommended to complete all of the following guides.

* :ref:`lan-ios` - Trust your Start9 server's Root Certificate Authority in order to securely connect over LAN.
* :ref:`tor-ios` - Run Tor natively (in the background) on your iOS device.  This will allow you to use applications on your device via the Tor Network so they can communicate with your Start9 server.
