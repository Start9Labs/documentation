==================
Connecting Locally
==================
When connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server, you can use its `.local` URLs for fast and secure connections.

All platforms
-------------

.. warning:: You cannot access .local URLs from the Tor Browser.

#. Ensure you have properly :ref:`downloaded and trusted your Root CA<trust-ca>`.

#. Ensure your client device (phone/laptop) is connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server. This usually means your server and your client device are using the same router, either by ethernet or WiFi.

#. Input your .local URL into the browser.

.. _connecting-lan-windows:

Windows only
------------
On Windows, it is necessary to install Bonjour Print Services in order to access the `.local` URLs of your installed services. In a future release of StartOS, this will no longer be necessary.

#. Download the `Bonjour installer </_static/bin/Bonjour64.msi>`_.

.. note:: The Bonjour installer linked above, which Apple bundles into iTunes, is hosted by Start9 for your convenience.  If you wish to obtain it directly from Apple to be more confident of its provenance, download `iTunes64 <https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64>`_ from Apple's official website and extract the files using a tool such as WinRAR. If you do not have WinRAR installed, you can download `here <https://www.win-rar.com/download.html>`_.

#. Run the **Bonjour64** package to install it.
