.. caution::  This guide assumes you are already :ref:`running Tor on your phone or computer<tor-os>`.

Once you have completed native :ref:`Tor Setup<tor-os>`, you can configure Firefox to use the Tor Network.  This will allow you to visit both ``.onion`` and "normal" (.com, .net, etc) websites from within the same browser.
