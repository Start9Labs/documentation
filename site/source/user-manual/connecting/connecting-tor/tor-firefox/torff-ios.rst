==================================
Configuring Firefox for Tor on iOS
==================================

.. caution::
  This guide assumes you have completed :ref:`setting up Tor for iOS<tor-ios>`. Please visit this section before proceeding as it is required for any regular browser such as Firefox to properly work with Tor.

Once Orbot is setup on your system as illustrated at the link above, you don't need to do anything special to have firefox or any other browser proxied via tor.  It should just work for any given onion url.
