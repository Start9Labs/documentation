==================================
Configuring Firefox for Tor on iOS
==================================

.. caution::
  This guide assumes you have completed :ref:`setting up Tor for iOS<tor-ios>`. Please visit this section before proceeding as it is required for any browser in iOS to work with Tor.

Once Orbot is setup on your system as illustrated at the link above, you don't need to do anything special to have any browser proxied via tor.  All browsers in iOS are Safari under the hood, and the way we've configured Orbot makes it so any browser will work for any given onion url, and won't use Tor for regular clearnet requests.
