Tor Connections
===============
You can connect to your Start9 server from anywhere in the world, privately and anonymously, by using its unique Tor Address (``.onion`` URL).

.. note:: Tor connection can sometimes be unreliable and have higher latency than normal internet connections.

Select your OS below to connect via Tor.  See our :ref:`Device Guides<device-guides>` section for all your client's setup guides.

  :ref:`Linux<tor-linux>`
  :ref:`Mac<tor-mac>`
  :ref:`Windows<tor-windows>`
  :ref:`Android<tor-android>`
  :ref:`iOS<tor-ios>`

Using TorBrowser
-------------------
.. caution::  Tor Browser will allow you to use your Start9 server's ``.onion`` URL without any manual configuration, however *all* connections are proxied via Tor, so you will not be able to access your Start9 server's ``.local`` LAN address with it.  `Using Firefox <#using-firefox>`_ is recommended over TorBrowser.

* Linux, Mac, Windows, Android

    * `Tor Browser <https://torproject.org/download/>`_

* iOS

    * iOS lacks a well-functioning Tor Browser. Use :ref:`Firefox<tor-ios>`.
