==================================
Trusting Your Start9 CA in Firefox
==================================
This guide applies to Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Librewolf.  Mozilla apps need to be configured to use the certificate store of your device.  To find out why Mozilla does this differently, you can read their `blog post <https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/02/14/why-does-mozilla-maintain-our-own-root-certificate-store/>`_ on the topic.

.. caution:: You will first need to complete :ref:`device setup<lan-os>` for your device before continuing.

        #. Open Firefox and enter ``about:config`` in the URL bar. Accept any warnings that may appear about changing advanced configuration preferences.

        #. Search for *security.enterprise_roots.enabled* and double click on *false* so that it turns to *true*:

        #. Now restart Firefox and you should now see this symbol indicating a secure connection:

        .. note:: If you see an exclamation point inside a triangle by the lock, you have made a security exception in the browser.  To remove it, click the lock and go to "Connection not secure":
