Trusting Embassy CA On Windows
==============================

Unfortunately, Windows does not have mDNS support built-in, which is necessary in order to visit .local addresses, so we recommend using the Bonjour service. Check out this :ref:`FAQ answer<why-bonjour>` for details.

#. Install `Bonjour Print Services <https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999>`_ on your Windows machine.

   .. tip::  If you are experiencing issues after installing Bonjour, you might have had a previous or failed install. To fix:

            #. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ECCB3bqNDQ
            #. Uninstall Bonjour completely via *system settings > remove programs*
            #. Reinstall Bonjour Printer Driver package (download at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US)
            #. Restart Windows
            #. Note: Uninstalling Bonjour via the setup package seems to be not enough to solve the issue. Bonjour must be uninstalled via windows system settings.

#. Back in Windows, right-click the “Start” menu and select “Run”.

#. Type in “mmc” and click “OK”. When prompted on the “User Account Control” window, select “Yes” to allow this program to run.
