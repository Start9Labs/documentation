Trusting Your Start9 CA On Windows
==================================

Unfortunately, Windows does not have mDNS alias support built-in, which is necessary in order to visit .local addresses for any service you install on your Start9 server, so we recommend using the Bonjour service. Check out this :ref:`FAQ answer<why-bonjour>` for details.

.. note:: Recently many users who have run through the following instructions have successfully connected to their Start9 server via LAN only to have it stop working a few days or weeks later. We believe this to be due to a recent change in Windows. When this happens the fix is to simply reinstall Bonjour and Bonjour Print Services. A solution is being worked on and Bonjour will not be necessary to connect to your Start9 server for much longer.

#. Install `Bonjour Print Services <https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999>`_ on your Windows machine.

   .. tip::  If you are experiencing issues after installing Bonjour, you might have had a previous or failed install. To fix:

            #. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ECCB3bqNDQ
            #. Uninstall Bonjour and Bonjour Print Services completely via *system settings > remove programs*
            #. Reinstall Bonjour Printer Driver package (download at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US)
            #. Restart Windows
            #. Note: Uninstalling Bonjour via the setup package seems to be not enough to solve the issue. Bonjour must be uninstalled via windows system settings.

#. Back in Windows, click the “Start” menu, type “mmc”, and select "Run as administrator" to access the Windows Management Console.

    When prompted with the “User Account Control” window, select “Yes” to allow this program to run.

#. When the Management Console opens, navigate to *File > Add/Remove Snap-in*.

#. When you return to the “Add or Remove Snap-ins” page, ensure “Certificates (Local Computer)” exists under “Console Root” in the “Selected snap-ins” section, then click “OK”.

#. Click “Next” on the first page of the Certificate Import Wizard, then browse to the location where you saved the downloaded certificate and open it.  Then click "Next".

#. On the “Certificate Store” window, ensure that it says “Trusted Root Certificate Authorities” and click “Next”.  Then click "Finish" on the final screen.

#. Verify your server's unique `<adjective-noun> Local Root CA` certificate is in the “Certificates” folder:

#. You can save the console settings (where we added a snap-in), if desired.  The CA certificate will remain imported to the CA certificate store either way, and you will likely use this guide if you need to import a new certificate.

You're now ready to browse your service UIs with encryption, either via the browser, or with native client apps.  You may wish to :ref:`configure Firefox<lan-ff>` and/or :ref:`Thunderbird<lan-thunderbird>` next.
