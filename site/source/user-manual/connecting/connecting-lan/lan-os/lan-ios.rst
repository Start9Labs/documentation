Trusting Your Server's CA on iOS
================================

This applies to iOS v15 and v16.  For older versions, see the `v14 guide </0.3.1.x/user-manual/connecting/connecting-lan/lan-os/lan-ios>`_.


#. Download the certificate to your Downloads folder

   .. note::
      In order to do this, open Safari and visit your Start9 server's .local URL while connected to WiFi, but make sure it is prefixed with `http://` and not `https://`.

      Log in using your password, then click the hamburger (3 lines) menu at the top right, select System > LAN > Download Certificate.  It may say `This website is trying to download a configuration profile.  Do you want to allow this?` Click `Allow`.

      Once this is done, you can skip to step 3, below.
      
      If you downloaded the certificate from a browser such as Firefox, you will need to copy the file from that Downloads folder to your iCloud Downloads folder.  Navigate there via `Files > iCloud Drive > Downloads`.  Otherwise, the "Profile Download" dialog will not appear when you click on the file in the next step.

#. Open your iCloud Downloads folder and click on the certificate.  It will display a dialog box that says "Profile Downloaded."  Click `Close`.
