#. Insert the microSD card into your computer, either directly or using an adapter.

#. Open balenaEtcher.

#. Click "Select Image" and select the ``.img`` file.

#. Click "Select Target" and select your microSD card.

    .. warning:: BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN you have selected the correct target microSD card. Whatever target you select will be **COMPLETELY ERASED**!!

#. Click "Flash!". You may be asked to (1) approve the unusually large disk target or (2) enter your password. Both are normal.

#. After the flash completes, you may remove the newly flashed micro SD card from any adapter, and insert it into your Embassy's SD card slot.

#. Finally, continue to the :ref:`Initial Setup <initial-setup>`, :ref:`Manual Update <manual-update>`, or :ref:`Reset Password <reset-password>` instructions - depending on your need.
