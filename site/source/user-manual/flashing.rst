Getting EmbassyOS
-----------------

After building your device, you need a copy of EmbassyOS.

* Visit the `latest EmbassyOS release page on Github <https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os/releases/latest>`_ to download an image of EmbassyOS.  It is `eos.tar.gz`.

Installing EmbassyOS
--------------------

Once you have the EmbassyOS image, you will need to flash it onto a microSD card.

#. Download `balenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_ onto your Linux, Mac, or Windows computer.
#. Insert the microSD card into your computer, either directly or using an adapter.
#. Open balenaEtcher.

#. Click "Select Image" and select your downloaded copy of EmbassyOS.
#. Click "Select Target" and select your 32GB microSD card.

    .. warning:: Be certain you have selected the correct target microSD card. Whatever target you select will be completely erased and replaced with EmbassyOS.

#. Click "Flash!". You may be asked to (1) approve the unusually large disk target or (2) enter your password. Both are normal.
#. After the flash completes, you may remove the micro SD from the adapter, insert it into your Embassy's SD card slot, and continue to the :ref:`Initial Setup <initial-setup>` or :ref:`Update by reflashing <manual-update>` instructions.
