Windows
-------

#. Install `Bonjour Print Services <https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999>`_ on your Windows machine. This is necessary in order to visit .local addresses on Windows.
#. If you are having issues running Bonjour after installing, you might have had Bonjour previously installed. To fix:

   #. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ECCB3bqNDQ
   #. Uninstall Bonjour completely via ``system settings -> remove programs``
   #. Reinstall Bonjour Printer Driver package (download at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US)
   #. Restart Windows
   #. Note: Uninstalling Bonjour via the setup package seems to be not enough to solve the issue. Bonjour must be uninstalled via windows system settings.
