**************************************
Setting up Firefox with Tor on Desktop
**************************************

.. warning::
  This guide assumes you have completed :ref:`setting up Tor<running-tor>`. Please visit this section first before you proceed as it is required for Firefox to properly work with Tor.

1. Open Firefox.

2. Enter ``about:config`` in the URL bar. Accept any warnings that may appear about accessing advanced settings.

3. Search for ``dom.securecontext.whitelist_onions`` and set the value to ``true``.

4. Download a `Proxy Auto Config` file to inform Firefox how to use the Tor daemon running on your computer. You can get Start9's standard file by following the OS-specific instructions below:

Windows:

Click `here <https://registry.start9labs.com/sys/proxy.pac>`_ to get the file and save the file somewhere you won’t delete it. For this example:

    .. code-block::

      C:\Program Files\Tor Browser\proxy.pac

Mac:

Open the `Terminal` App on your Mac. You can find it in your list of Applications.  In the terminal, enter:

    .. code-block::

      brew install wget

    And then:

    .. code-block::

      wget -P /usr/local/etc/tor https://registry.start9labs.com/sys/proxy.pac

Linux:

From a terminal, enter:

    .. code-block::

      sudo wget -P /etc/tor https://registry.start9labs.com/sys/proxy.pac


5. Now open your Firefox web browser, and select options (Windows), or preferences (Mac/Linux):

    Select :menuselection:`Settings --> Options`


6. Search for the term “proxy” in the search bar in the upper right, then select the button that says `Settings…`:

7. This should open a menu that will allow you to configure your proxy settings. Select `Automatic proxy configuration URL` and paste in the path to your PAC file from earlier, prefixed with ``file://``. For example:

Windows:

   .. code-block::

    file://C:/Program Files/Tor Browser/proxy.pac

Mac:

   .. code-block::

    file:///usr/local/etc/tor/proxy.pac

Linux:

   .. code-block::

    file:///etc/tor/proxy.pac

8. Then, check the box labeled `Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5`:

9. Click ``OK`` and then restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

10. You’re all set! You should now be able to navigate to `.onion` URLs in Firefox. This means you can bookmark Cups Messenger, and use your Bitwarden Tor address in the `Bitwarden Firefox Plugin <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/>`_.
